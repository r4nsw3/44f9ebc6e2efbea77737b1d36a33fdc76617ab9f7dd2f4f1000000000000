  |   Pinball FX3 is the BIGGEST, most COMMUNITY focused pinball game       |
  |   ever created. Multiplayer matchups, user generated tournaments and    |
  |   league play create endless opportunity for pinball competition.       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Zen Studios is also excited to reveal that in addition to the         |
  |   classic true to form simulations, the studio is also producing        |
  |   remastered versions of the classic tables which will include 3D       |
  |   interactive characters, side wall art, ball trailer effects,          |
  |   particle effects and more. Remastered versions of the tables can      |
  |   be played with both the new classic physics simulation or with        |
  |   Zen’s modern-day pinball physics simulation.                          |
  |                                                                         |
